# Theory of Stellar athopsheres - exercises

This is the main repository for the materials that supplement the topics covered by the lecture. 
I will upload here some jupyter notebooks and pdf files that may help to understand the theory.

**Webpage of classes can be found [here](https://www.rozanskit.com/teaching/tag1920/) (in Polish)**

## Materials

### [Empirical model of the Sun](Empirical%20model%20of%20the%20Sun.ipynb)

This notebook shows how given the limb darkening we can estimate the temperature dependence in the solar photosphere.

## Exercises

### [FAL-C Solar atmosphere model](FAL-C%20Solar%20atmosphere%20model.ipynb)

This notebook explore a FALC solar atmopshere model and includes eight exercises that help to undersand the physics incorporated in this modelling. It is based on B. Rutten exercises availible at [webpage](https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~rutte101/).
